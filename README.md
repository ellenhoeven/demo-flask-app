# demo-flask-app
This project is a flask app that shows random gifs of cats to experiment with Python's Flask module.
It is based on OpenTechSchool's Flask Tutorial. In addition to the tutorial, I created a menu on the first place and the feature showing random gifs.

# Get started:
- ```git clone demo-flask-app```
- ```cd demo-flask-app```
- ```pip3 install venv``` to create your environment
- ```source venv/bin/activate``` to enter the virtual environment
- ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

# Run:
- ```python catseverywhere.py```
- Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, this is where your app will be running
